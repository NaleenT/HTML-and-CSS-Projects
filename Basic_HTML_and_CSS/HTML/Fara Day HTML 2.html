    <h1>1. Mending</h1>
        <h2>Transmutation cantrip</h2>
            <p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it. Leave no trace of the former damage.</p>

        <h2>Divination cantrip</h2>
            <p>You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.</p>
    <h1>3. Prestidigitation</h1>

            <li>You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.</li>
            <li>You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
            <li>You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</li>
